# mc-daemon
Enhance the experience of managing a self-hosted Minecraft server.

## What is mc-daemon?

`mc-daemon` is a highly extensible service designed to improve the experience of both you managing the server, and the players interacting with it help you manage your Minecraft server.

It's features are organized in two main layers:
- **Embedded Layer**: Automates routine tasks such as detecting server crashes and shutting down the server when it's empty for a while
- **Discord Integration Layer**: Provides both players and admins with a suit of convenient slash commands for seamlessly managing the server from Discord, as well as event logging on text channels

For instance, instead of having to manually open the server each time a player wants to join, users can simply use the `/start` command on Discord to open the server themselves.
