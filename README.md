# mc-daemon
`mc-daemon` is a highly extensible service designed to enhance the experience of managing a small, self-hosted Minecraft server.

It's features are organized in two main layers:
- **Embedded Layer**: Automates routine tasks such as detecting server crashes and shutting down the server when it's empty for a while
- **Discord Integration Layer**: Provides both players and admins with a suit of convenient slash commands for seamlessly managing the server from Discord

For instance, instead of having to manually open the server each time a player wants to join, users can simply use the `/start` command on Discord to open the server themselves.
